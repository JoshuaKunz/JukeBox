# Welcome to My Jukebox Repo

## How to use this app:

* You must use MP3 files, the algorithms use the metadata from the MP3 files to collect the Images, and other song/album data.
* To get the MP3 metadata easily, just open up Groove Music and edit your MP3 files from there.
* You must have the .NET Core 3.1 runtime installed

## Contributors
